ZEUS is a modern build system featuring support for writing build targets in *multiple scripting languages*,
an *interactive shell* with *tab completion* and customizable ANSI color profiles as well as support for *keybindings*.

It parses the **zeus** directory in your project,
to find commands either via a single file **zeus/commands.yml** or via scripts in the **zeus/scripts** directory.

A command can have *typed parameters* and commands can be *chained*.
Each command can have dependencies which will be resolved prior to execution, similar to GNU Make targets.

For each dependency target outputs can be defined, the target will be skipped if all named outputs exist.
You can export global variables and functions visible to all scripts.

The *Event Engine* allows the user to register file system events,
and run custom shell or ZEUS commands when an event occurs.

ZEUS also features an auto *formatter* for shell scripts,
a *bootstrapping* functionality and a rich set of customizations available by using a config file.

ZEUS can save and restore project specific data such as *events*,
*keybindings*, *aliases*, *milestones*, *author*, *build number* and a project *deadline*.

[YAML](http://yaml.org) is used for serialization of the ***zeus/config.yml***, ***zeus/data.yml*** and **zeus/commands.yml** files.

ZEUS was designed to happily coexist with GNU Make,
and offers a builtin Makefile *command overview* and *migration assistance*.

The 1.0 Release will feature an optional *webinterface*, *markdown / HTML report generation* and an *encrypted storage* for sensitive information.

The name ZEUS refers to the ancient greek god of the *sky and thunder*.

When starting the interactive shell there is a good chance you will be struck by a *lighting* and bitten by a *cobra*,
which could lead to enormous **super coding powers**!

The Dark Mode does not work in terminals with a black background, because it contains black text colors.
I recommend using the solarized dark terminal theme, if you want to use the dark mode.

## Preface

**Why not GNU Make?**

GNU Make has its disadvantages:
For large projects you will end up with few hundred lines long Makefile,
that is hard to read, overloaded and annoying to maintain.

Also writing pure shell is not possible, instead the make shell dialect is used.
If you ever tried writing an if condition in a Makefile you will know what I'm talking about ;)

My goal was to offer extended functionality and usability,
with better structuring options for large projects and the programmers choice of his favourite scripting language.

ZEUS keeps things structured and reusable,
the scripts can also be executed manually without ZEUS if needed (you can generate a standalone version of them with the **generate** builtin).

Also, generic scripts can be reused in multiple projects.

Similar to GNU Make, ZEUS offers stopping shellscript execution,
if a line returned an error code != 0.

This Behaviour can be disabled in the config by using the **StopOnError** option.
Other languages such as python or ruby have this behaviour by default.

Signals to the ZEUS shell will be passed to the scripts, that means handling signals inside the scripts is possible.

***Terminology***

Command Prompts:

```shell
# shell commands
$ ls

# ZEUS interactive shell prompt
zeus Â»
```

Usage Descriptions:

```shell
# no parentheses: built in commands
# [] parentheses: optional parameters
# <> parentheses: values that need to be supplied by the user
milestones [remove <name>] [set <name> <0-100>] [add <name> <date> [description]]
```

## Installation

### Homebrew

```shell
$ brew tap dreadl0ck/formulas
$ brew install zeus
```

### Github

```shell
$ go get -v -u github.com/dreadl0ck/zeus
```

> NOTE: This might take a while, because some assets are embedded into the binary to make it position independent. Time to get a coffee

ZEUS uses ZEUS as its build system!
After the initial install simply run **zeus** inside the project directory,
to get the command overview.

### Tools

I also recommend installing the amazing [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) text editor,
as this is the default editor for the edit command. Don't worry you can also use vim if desired.

Also nice to have is the [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) tool,
which means count lines of code and is used for the *info* builtin.

OSX Users can grab both with:

```shell
$ brew install cloc micro
...
```

### Development

When developing compile with: (this compiles without assets and is much faster)

```shell
$ zeus/scripts/dev.sh
...
```

## Try it out

After installation, cd into the project repository and run **zeus**.

This will show you the way ZEUS is used to compile itself. Run **edit commands** to look at the projects *commands.yml*

For more complex examples, move into the **tests** directory and run **zeus** there.
You will find examples for arguments, async commands, dependencies and multi language setups there.
Run **edit commands** to look at the projects *commands.yml* to see how things work there.

## Configuration

The config file **zeus/config.yml** allows various customizations.

When a ZEUS instance is running in interactive mode, this file is being watched and parsed when a WRITE event occurs.

ZEUS will warn you about unknown config fields.

However, the builtin *config* command is recommended for editing the config,
it features tab completion for all config fields, actions and values.

    Usage:
    config [get <field>]
    config [set <field> <value>]

**Config Options:**

| Option              | Type                     | Description                              |

| disableTimestamps   | bool                     | disable timestamps when logging          |
| stopOnError         | bool                     | stop script execution when there's an error inside a script |
| dumpScriptOnError   | bool                     | dump the currently processed script into a file if an error occurs |
| dateFormat          | string                   | set the format string for dates, used by deadline and milestones |
| todoFilePath        | string                   | set the path for your TODO file, default is: "TODO.md" |
| editor              | string                   | configure editor for the edit builtin    |
| colorProfiles       | map[string]*ColorProfile | add custom color profiles                |
| languages           | []*Language              | add custom language definitions          |

> NOTE: when modifying the Debug or Colors field, you need to restart zeus in order for the changes to take effect. That's because the Log instance is a global variable, and manipulating it on the fly produces data races.


## Interactive Shell

ZEUS has a built in interactive shell with tab completion for all its commands!
All scripts inside the **zeus/scripts/** directory will be treated and parsed as commands.

To start the interactive shell inside your project, simply run:

```shell
$ cd project_folder
$ zeus
...
```

This will print all available commands, their description, arguments, dependencies, outputs etc
To get a quick overview whats available for the current project.

### Default Readline Keybindings

The Interactive Shell uses the [readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline) library,
here are the default Keybindings:

`Meta`+`B` means press `Esc` and `n` separately.
Users can change that in terminal simulator(i.e. iTerm2) to `Alt`+`B`
Notice: `Meta`+`B` is equals with `Alt`+`B` in windows.

| Other                   | Exit Complete Select Mode                |

### Shell Integration

When ZEUS does not know the command you typed it will be passed down to the underlying shell.
That means you can use git and all other shell tools without having to leave the interactive shell!

This behaviour can be disabled by using the *PassCommandsToShell* option.
There is path and command completion for basic shell commands (cat, ls, ssh, git, tree etc)

> Remember: Events, Aliases and Keybindings can contain shell commands!

> NOTE: Multilevel path completion is broken, I'm working on a fix.

### Bash Completions

If you also want tab completion when not using the interactive shell,
install the bash-completion package which is available for most linux distros and macOS.

on macOS you can install it with brew:

```
brew install bash-completion
```

on linux use the package manager of your distro.

Then add the completion file **files/zeus** to:

- macOS: /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/
- Linux: /etc/bash_completion.d/

and source it with:

- macOS: . /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/zeus
- Linux: . /etc/bash_completion.d/zeus

### Direct Command Execution

You don't need the interactive shell to run commands, just use the following syntax:

```shell
$ zeus [commandName] [args]
...
```

This is useful for scripting or using ZEUS from another programming language.
Note that you can use the bash-completions package and the completion script **files/zeus** to get tab completion on the shell.

## Builtins

ZEUS includes a lot of useful builtins,
the following builtin commands are available:

| Command            | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| *format*           | run the formatter for all scripts        |
| *config*           | print or change the current config       |
| *deadline*         | print or change the deadline             |

| *keys*             | manage keybindings                       |
| *web*              | start webinterface                       |
| *wiki*             | start web wiki                           |
| *create*           | bootstrap a single command               |
| *git-filter*       | filter git log output                    |
| *todo*             | manage todos                             |
| *update*           | update zeus version                      |
| *procs*            | manage spawned processes                 |
| *edit*             | edit scripts                             |
| *generate*         | generate standalone version of a script or commandChain |

you can list them by using the **builtins** command.

The default Editor for the edit command is [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io)
Fallback is vim, but you can configure your desired editor in the config.

Some will be explained in more detail below, the rest of the builtins is explained in different sections.

### Edit Builtin

    usage: edit [ <commandName> | config | globals | commands ] [ line <number> ]

The **edit** builtin allows you to modify scripts without leaving the interactive shell using your favourite editor!
Default is micro, fallback is vim, but can also use the *Editor* config field to set a custom editor.

When the project uses a Commandsfile, the edit builtin will load the Commandsfile at the correct position of the requested command.
Use the *line* subcommand to jump to the desired line.

Also editing config, data and globals is possible.

It does also play nice with the builtin shellscript formatter.

```

### Generate Builtin

    usage: generate <outputName> <commandChain>

The **generate** builtin generates a standalone version of a single command or commandChain.

If all commands are of the same language, a single script is generated.
If there are multiple scripting languages involved, a directory is generated with all required scripts and a *run.sh* script, that executes the first element of the commandChain.

examples:

```shell
# generate a standalone version of the build command, with all globals and dependencies
zeus Â» generate build.sh build

# generate a standalone version of the commandChain, with all globals and dependencies
# scenario1: only shell scripts
zeus Â» generate deploy_server.sh clean -> configure -> build -> deploy ip=167.149.1.2

# scenario2: mixed languages
# this will create a deploy_server directory with all required scripts and generated code to execute them in the order of the commandChain
zeus Â» generate deploy_server clean -> configure -> build -> deploy ip=167.149.1.2
```

### Create Builtin

     usage: create [<language> <commandName>] [script <all> | <commandName>]

The create builtin can be used for 2 purposes:

1) bootstrap a new command and start the editor

```shell
zeus Â» create python newPythonCommand
```

A new python command will be appended to the commandsFile and the editor will be launched.

2) write the exec section of a command to a file

```shell
zeus Â» create script build
```

Assuming build is shellscript, the exec section will be written to **zeus/scripts/build.sh** and stripped from the commandsFile

### Todo Builtin

    usage: todo [add <task>] [remove <index>]

The **todo** builtin is a simple tool for working with *TODO.md* files,
it allows you to list, add and remove tasks in the interactive shell.

A task is considered a note with prefix: -

Default path for todo file is *TODO.md* in the root of the project.

You can specify a custom path in the config, using the *TodoFilePath* field.

### Procs Builtin

    usage: procs [detach <command>] [attach <pid>] [kill <pid>]

The procs builtin allows you to detach commands (execute them async),
list or kill spawned processes and attach Stdin + Stdout + Stderr to a running process.

> NOTE: there are tab completions for PIDs

### Git Filter Builtin

    usage: git-filter [keyword]

A very simple filter for git commits,
outputs one commit per line and can be filtered for keywords like using the UNIX grep command.

> NOTE: This is still work in progress

### Aliases

You can specify aliases for ZEUS or shell commands.
This is handy when using commands with lots of arguments,
or for common git or ssh operations.

Aliases will be added to the tab completer, saved in the project data and restored every time you run ZEUS.

```shell
zeus Â» alias set gs git status
zeus Â» gs
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
...
```

Running *alias* without params will print the current aliases:

```shell
zeus Â» alias
gs = git status
```

### Events

Events for the following filesystem operations can be created: WRITE | REMOVE | RENAME | CHMOD

When an operation of the specified type occurs on the watched file (or on any file inside a directory),
a custom command is executed. This can be a ZEUS or any shell command.

Events can be bound to a specific file type, by supplying the filetype before the command:

```shell
zeus Â» events add WRITE docs/ .md say hello
```

Filetypes feature completion, just specify the directory and hit tab to see a list of filetypes inside the directory.

Example for a simple WRITE event on a single file:

```shell
zeus Â» events add WRITE TODO.md say updated TODO
```

Running *events* without params will print the current events:

```shell
zeus Â» events
custom event        a63d8659d6243630    WRITE               say wiki updated    .md               wiki/
config event        58c41a66bf6efde4    WRITE               internal            .yml               zeus/config.yml
```

Note that you can also see the internal ZEUS events used for watching the config file,
and for watching the shellscripts inside the **zeus** directory to run the formatter on change.

For removing an event specify its path:

```shell
zeus Â» events remove TODO.md
  INFO removed event with name TODO.md
```


### Milestones

For a structured workflow milestones can be created.

A Milestone tracks the progress of a particular programming task inside the project,
and contains an expected date and an optional description.

   Usage:
   milestones [remove <name>]
   milestones [set <name> <0-100>]
   milestones [add <name> <date> [description]]

Add a milestone to the project:

```shell
zeus Â» milestones add Testing 12-12-2018 Finish testing
  INFO added milestone Testing
```

list the current milestones with:

```shell
zeus Â» milestones
Milestones:
# 0 [                    ] 0% name: Testing date: 12-12-2018 description: Finish testing
```

set a milestones progress with:

```shell
zeus Â» milestones set Testing 50
zeus Â» milestones
Milestones:
# 0 [==========          ] 50% name: Testing date: 12-12-2018 description: Finish testing
```


### Project Deadline

    Usage:
    deadline [remove]
    deadline [set <date>]

A global project Deadline can also be set:

```shell
zeus Â» deadline set 24-12-2018
  INFO added deadline for 24-12-2018
```

get the current deadline with:

```shell
zeus Â» deadline
Deadline: 24-12-2018
```


### Keybindings

Keybindings allow mapping ZEUS or shell commands to Ctrl-[A-Z] Key Combinations.

    Usage:
    keys [set <KeyComb> <commandChain>]
    keys [remove <KeyComb>]

To see a list of current keybindings, run *keys* in the interactive shell:

```shell
zeus Â» keys
Ctrl-B = build
Ctrl-S = git status
Ctrl-P = git push
```

To set a Keybinding:

```shell
zeus Â» keys set Ctrl-H help
```

> NOTE: use [TAB] for completion of available keybindings

To remove a Keybinding:

```shell
zeus Â» keys remove Ctrl-H
```

> NOTE: some key combination such as Ctrl-C (SIGINT) are not available because they are handled by the shell

### Auto Formatter

The Auto Formatter watches the scripts inside the **zeus** directory and formats them when a WRITE Event occurs.

Currently this is only available for Shellscripts, but I plan to add formatters for more languages & add an option to add custom ones.

However changing the file contents while your IDE holds a buffer of it in memory,
does not play well with all IDEs and Editors and should ideally be implemented as IDE Plugin.

My IDE (VSCode) complains sometimes that the content on disk is newer,
but most of the time its works ok.
Please note that for VSCode you have to CMD-S twice before the buffer from the IDE gets written to disk.

> NOTE:
> Since this causes trouble with most IDEs and editors, its disabled by default
> You can enable this feature in the config if you want to try it with your editor
> When setting the AutoFormat Option to true, the DumpScriptOnError option will also be enabled

Formatting seems to work well with the *micro* editor,
so when editing your scripts with the **edit** builtin, try it out!

### ANSI Color Profiles

Colors are used for good readability and can be configured by using the config file.

You can add multiple color profiles and configure them to your taste.

there are 5 default profiles: dark, light, default, off, black

To change the color profile to dark:

```shell
zeus Â» colors dark
```

> NOTE: dark mode is strongly recommended :) use the solarized dark theme for optimal terminal background.

For configuring color profiles in the config, use the style format from the ansi go package:

#### ANSI Style Format

```go
"foregroundColor+attributes:backgroundColor+attributes"
```

Colors

* black
* red
* green
* yellow
* blue
* magenta
* cyan
* white
* 0...255 (256 colors)

Foreground Attributes

* B = Blink
* b = bold
* h = high intensity (bright)
* i = inverse
* s = strikethrough
* u = underline

Background Attributes

* h = high intensity (bright)

### Makefile Integration

By using the **makefile** command you can get an overview of targets available in a Makefile:

```shell
zeus Â» makefile
available GNUMake Commands:
~> clean
~> configure
~> status
~> backup
~> bench: build
~> test: clean
~> debug: build
~> build: clean
~> deploy
```

This might be helpful when switching to ZEUS or when using both for whatever reason.

Currently the following actions are performed:

- globals will be extracted and put into the **zeus/globals.sh** file
- variable conversion from '$(VAR)' to the bash dialect: '$VAR'
- shell commands will be converted from '@command' to 'command'
- calls to 'make target' will be replaced with 'zeus target'
- if statements will be converted to bash dialect

> NOTE:
> Makefile migration is not yet perfect!
> Always look at the generated files, and check if the output makes sense.
> Especially automatic migration of make target arguments has not been implemented yet.
> Also switch statement conversion is currently missing.

### Makefile Migration Assistance

ZEUS helps you migrate from Makefiles, by parsing them and transforming the build targets into a ZEUS structure.
Your Makefile will remain unchanged, Makefiles and ZEUS can happily coexist!

simply run this from the interactive shell:

```shell
zeus Â» makefile migrate
```

or from the commandline:

```shell
$ zeus makefile migrate
~> clean
~> configure
~> status
~> backup
...
[INFO] migration complete.
```

Your makefile will remain unchanged. This command creates the **zeus** directory with your make commands as ZEUS scripts.
If there are any global variables declared in your Makefile, they will be extracted and put into the **zeus/globals.sh** file.


### Bootstrapping

When starting from scratch, you can use the bootstrapping functionality:

```shell
$ zeus bootstrap
...
```

This will create the **zeus** folder, and bootstrap the basic commands (build, clean, run, install, test, bench),
including a *commands.yml* file. Happy Coding!

### Webinterface

The Webinterface will allow to track the build status and display project information,
execute build commands and much more!

Communication happens live over a websocket.

When **WebInterface** is enabled in the config the server will be started when launching ZEUS.
Otherwise use the **web** builtin to start the server from the shell.

> NOTE: This is still work in progress

### Markdown Wiki

A Markdown Wiki will be served from the projects **wiki** directory.

All Markdown Documents in the **wiki/docs** folder can be viewed in the browser,
which makes creating good project docs very easy.

The **wiki/INDEX.md** file will be converted to HTML and inserted in main wiki page.

### Command Chains

Targets (aka commands) can be chained, using the **->** operator

By using the **dependencies** field you can specify a command chain (or a single command),
that will be run before execution of the target script.

Individual commands from this chain will be skipped if they have outputs that do already exist!

This command chain will be executed from left to right,
each of the commands can also contain dependencies and so on.

You can also assemble & run command chains in the interactive shell.
This is useful for testing chains and see the result instantly.

A simple example:

```shell
# clean the project, build for amd64 and deploy the binary on the server
zeus Â» clean -> build-amd64 -> deploy
```

## Commandsfile

Similar to GNU Make, ZEUS allows adding all targets to a single file named commands.yml inside the **zeus** directory.
This is useful for small projects and you can still use the interactive shell if desired.

The File follows the [YAML](http://yaml.org) specification.

ZEUS will warn you about about unknown fields, duplicate command names and global variables.
Cyclic commandchains produce an error at runtime.

There is an example **commands.yml** in the tests directory.
A watcher event is automatically created for parsing the file again on WRITE events.

Use the globals section to export global variables and function to all commands.

If you want to move to a zeus directory structure after a while, use the *create* builtin:

```shell
zeus Â» create script all
migrated  10  commands from Commandsfile in:  4.575956ms
```

This will write the exec section of each command into a separate script in **zeus/scripts** and strip the section from your commandsFile.

If an error occurs, ZEUS will print a snippet of the generated script and highlight the corresponding line.

## Globals

Globals allow you to declare variables and functions in global scope and share them among all ZEUS scripts.

You have two options:

1. **globals** section in your commands.yml for global variables visible to all scripts
2. **zeus/globals/globals.[scriptExtension]** for language specific code such as functions

> NOTE: Your current shells environment will be passed to each executed command.
> That means global variables from ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile are accessible by default

Globals will be accessible in your scripts as normal variables!

## Command Data

Scripts supply information in the **zeus/commands.yml** file.

A simple ZEUS command could look like this:

```yaml
exampleCommand:
    dependencies: clean
    outputs:
        - bin/zeus
    description: build project
    buildNumber: true
    exec: go build -o bin/zeus
    help: |
        zeus build script
        this script produces the zeus binary
        it will be be placed in bin/zeus
```

**Fields:**

| Field          | Type     | Description                              |
| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| *dependencies* | []string   | dependencies for the current command     |
| *description*  | string   | short description text for command overview |
| *help*         | string   | help text for help builtin               |
| *outputs*      | []string | output files of the command              |
| *buildNumber*  | bool     | increase build number when this field is present |
| *async*        | bool     | detach script into background            |
| *arguments*         | []string     | list of typed arguments, allows optionals and default values |
| *path*         | string     | custom path for script file|
| *exec*         | string     | supply script directly            |

*All data fields are optional.*
Just throw your scripts into **zeus/scripts/** fire up the interactive shell and start hacking!

The help text can be accessed by using the **help** builtin:

```shell
zeus Â» help build

zeus build script
this script produces the zeus binary
it will be be placed in bin/zeus
```

### Description

ZEUS uses the description field for a short description text,
which will be displayed on startup by default or when using the **help** builtin without params.

### Help

A multiline help text can be set for each script by using the *help* field.

```shell
zeus Â» help <command>
```

You can get the projects command overview at any time just type help in the interactive shell:

```shell
zeus Â» help
```

### Outputs

For each target you can define multiple outputs files with the *outputs* field.
When all of them exist, the command will not be executed again.

example:

```yaml
outputs:
    - bin/file1
    - bin/file2
```

### Dependencies

The *dependencies* field allows you to specify multiple commands, that will be executed in the declared order,
prior to the execution of the current command.

A Dependency will be skipped if all its outputs files or directories exist.

Since Dependencies are ZEUS commands, they can have arguments.

example:

```yaml
dependencies:
    - command1 <arg1> <arg2>
    - command2 <arg1>
    - command3
```


### Async

The **async** field allows to run a command in the background.
It will be detached with the UNIX *screen* command and you can attach to its output at any time using the **procs** builtin.

This can be used to speed up builds with lots of targets that don't have dependencies between them,
or to start multiple services in the background.

The **procs** builtin can be used to list all running commands, to attach to them or to detach non-async commands in the background.

### Exec

The **exec** field allows to specify the code to run directly in the commandsfile.

If this field is empty or missing, ZEUS assumes your script resides in the **zeus/scripts/** directory,
and has the name **commandName.[fileExtension]**

### Path

The **path** field allows to specify a custom path for the script.

If a command has a custom path set and an exec action specified an error is thrown upon command initialization.

### Arguments

ZEUS supports typed command arguments.

To declare them, supply a comma separated list to the **zeus-args** field,
following this scheme: **label:Type**

Available types are: **Int, String, Float, Bool**

Arguments are being passed in the label=val format:

```shell
zeus Â» build name=testbuild
```

The order in which they appear does NOT matter (because of the labels)

It is also possible to create optional arguments: **label:Type?**

They won't be required for executing the command, and if no value was supplied they will be initialized with the *zero value for their data type*

You can set a default value for optional arguments: **label:Type? = value**

Lets look at an example for declaration:

```yaml
argumentTest:
    description: test optional args
    arguments:
        - name:String? = "defaultName"
        - author:String
        - ok:Bool?
        - count:Int?
```

Here's an example of how this looks like in the interactive shell:

```
commands
ââââ build (binName: String)
|    ââââ dependencies  clean -> configure
|    ââââ buildNumber
|    ââââ description   build project for current OS
|
ââââ argTest (author:String, ok:Bool?, count:Int?, name:String? = "defaultName")
|    ââââ dependencies  clean -> configure
|    ââââ description   demonstrate arguments
```

The *build* command has one argument with the label 'binName', its a string and its required.
> NOTE: there will be a parse error if an argument label shadows a global, because both share the same name.

The *argTest* command has 4 arguments, 3 of them are optional.
The only one required is the 'author' argument.
> NOTE: required args will always appear first in the list of arguments.
> If dismissed 'name' will be initialized with 'defaultName', the rest will be set to the zero values of their data types. (false, 0)

Accessing the arguments inside your scripts is easy:
Since they will be inserted prior to any code of the command, you can just treat the like global variables in your chosen scripting language.

So for Shellscripts, use $label to access them.

> NOTE: use tab to get completion for available labels in the interactive shell

### Scripting Languages

ZEUS now supports **bash**, **ruby**, **python**, **lua** and **javascript** for writing your commands!

You can also run commandChains that contain commands of different languages!

The default language is bash.
If you wish to change a single commands language, simply add the language field directly on the command!

Adding custom languages in the config:

If you wish to add a custom language, have a look at the Language struct in *language.go*
and supply all required fields in the configs *Languages* section in the config.

You can also override the default languages, for example if you want to use *nodejs* as js interpreter,
instead of the default OSX *osascript* interpreter.

For macOS javascript is particularly interesting, because it can be used to interact with the system,
display GUI elements like progress bars, import ObjC libs and more!

### Build Number

Set the **buildNUmber** field to true to increase the projects buildNumber for every execution of the command!

## Internals

ANSI Escape Sequences are from the [ansi](https://github.com/mgutz/ansi) package.

The interactive shell uses the [readline](https://github.com/chzyer/readline) library,
although some modifications were made to make the path completion work.

For shell script formatting the [syntax](https://godoc.org/github.com/mvdan/sh/syntax) package is used.

Here's a simple overview of the architecture:

![alt text](https://github.com/dreadl0ck/zeus/blob/master/wiki/docs/zeus_overview.jpg "ZEUS Overview")

### Error Dumps

When a script fails and the **dumpScriptOnError** config field is set to *true*,
ZEUS will create a dump of the generated script in **zeus/dumps**.

The dump contains a timestamp, the ZEUS version, the stdErr output of the command and the error message from the process.
The file will be named **error_dump.[fileExtension]** according to the scripting language of the command.

For every language only the last failed script dump will be preserved.

### Tests

ZEUS has automated tests for its core functionality.

run the tests with:

```
zeus Â» test
```

Without failed assertions, on macOS the coverage report will be opened in your Browser.

On Linux you will need to open it manually, using the generated html file.

### Race Detection Tests

To run the test with race detection enabled:

```shell
zeus Â» test-race
```

The Go Test functions in *zeus_test.go* can also be executed in isolation, either on the commandline or via the VSCode golang plugin inside the IDE.

> NOTE: The tests are still work in progress. Code coverage is currently at ~ 50%

### OS Support

ZEUS was developed on OSX, and thus supports OSX and Linux.

Windows is currently not supported! This might change in the future.

### Assets

ZEUS uses asset embedding to provide a path independent executable.
For this [rice](https://github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice) is used.

If you want to work on ZEUS source, you need to install the tool with:

```shell
$ go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice
$ go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice
...
```

The assets currently contains the shell asciiArt as well the bare scripts for the bootstrap command.
You can find all assets in the **assets** directory.

### Vendoring

ZEUS is vendored with go modules.
That means it is independent of any API changes in the used libraries and will work seamlessly in the future!

### Notes

#### Background Processes

Spawning jobs inside a script with & is a good idea if you want to interact with them in the context of the current command (for example to use sudo to start your server on a privileged port)

But keep in mind that ZEUS will not wait for these background processes and they will not be tracked in the processMap.

### Coming Soon

The listed features will be implemented over the next weeks.
After that the 1.0 Release is expected.

- Markdown / HTML Report Generation

     A generated Markdown build report that can be converted to HTML,
     which allows adding nice fonts and syntax highlighting for dumped output.
     I think this is especially interesting for archiving unit test results.

- Encrypted Storage

     Projects can contain sensitive information like encryption keys or passwords.

     Lets search for github commits that include 'remove password': [search](https://github.com/search?utf8=â&q=remove+password&type=Commits&ref=searchresults)

     283,905 results. Oops.

     Oh wait, there's more: [click](http://thehackernews.com/2013/01/hundreds-of-ssh-private-keys-exposed.html)

     ZEUS 1.0 will feature encrypted storage inside the project data,
     that can be accessed and modified using the interactive shell.

### Bugs

Multilevel Path tab completion is still broken, the reason for this seems to be an issue in the readline library.
I forked readline and currently experiment with a solution.

> NOTE: Please notify me about any issues you encounter during testing.
