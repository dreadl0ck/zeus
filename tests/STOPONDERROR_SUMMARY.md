# stopOnError Test Suite - Summary

## Created Files

### Test Scripts (in `tests/zeus/scripts/`)

1. **test-stop-on-error.sh**
   - Basic test with `stopOnError=true`
   - Verifies execution stops after first failure
   - Expected: Messages after `false` command should NOT appear

2. **test-continue-on-error.sh**
   - Basic test with `stopOnError=false`
   - Verifies execution continues after failures
   - Expected: Messages after `false` command SHOULD appear

3. **test-stop-on-error-chain.sh**
   - Complex test with file operations and `stopOnError=true`
   - Creates file, attempts invalid read, should NOT cleanup
   - Expected: Cleanup code should not execute

4. **test-continue-on-error-chain.sh**
   - Complex test with file operations and `stopOnError=false`
   - Creates file, attempts invalid read, SHOULD cleanup
   - Expected: All operations complete including cleanup
   - ✅ Verified working (test passed)

5. **test-stop-on-error-suite.sh**
   - Comprehensive automated test suite
   - Tests 5 different scenarios
   - Provides detailed pass/fail reporting
   - ✅ All tests passing (5/5)

### Command Definitions (in `tests/zeus/commands.yml`)

Added the following commands:

- `test-stop-on-error` (existing, inline exec)
- `test-continue-on-error` (existing, inline exec)
- `test-stop-on-error-chain` (new, references script file)
- `test-continue-on-error-chain` (new, references script file)
- `test-stop-on-error-with-deps` (new, tests dependencies)
- `test-stop-on-error-suite` (new, runs comprehensive test suite)

### Documentation

1. **STOPONDERROR_TESTS.md** - Comprehensive documentation including:
   - Overview of stopOnError functionality
   - Description of each test command
   - How to run the tests
   - Validation checklist
   - Notes on multi-language support

2. **STOPONDERROR_SUMMARY.md** (this file) - Quick reference

## Quick Start

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
cd tests
zeus test-stop-on-error           # Should stop on error
zeus test-continue-on-error       # Should continue on error
zeus test-stop-on-error-chain     # Complex stopOnError=true test
zeus test-continue-on-error-chain # Complex stopOnError=false test
```

### Run Complete Test Suite
```bash
cd tests
zeus test-stop-on-error-suite     # Runs all automated tests
```

### Run Scripts Directly (without Zeus)
```bash
cd tests
bash zeus/scripts/test-continue-on-error-chain.sh
bash zeus/scripts/test-stop-on-error-suite.sh
```

## Test Results

✅ **test-stop-on-error-suite.sh**: All 5 tests passing
- Test 1: stopOnError=true stops execution ✓
- Test 2: stopOnError=false continues execution ✓
- Test 3: Command substitution handling ✓
- Test 4: Pipeline handling ✓
- Test 5: Explicit exit code stops execution ✓

✅ **test-continue-on-error-chain.sh**: Working as expected
- File creation successful
- Handles errors gracefully
- Continues to cleanup
- All operations complete

## Configuration

The test environment uses:
- **Global config**: `stopOnError: true` (in `tests/zeus/config.yml`)
- **Per-command override**: Each test command specifies its own `stopOnError` setting
- **Language**: bash (default for tests)

## Notes

- All script files are executable (`chmod +x`)
- Scripts include clear success/failure indicators (✓/✗)
- Temporary files are created in `/tmp/` and cleaned up
- Tests are self-contained and can run independently
- Works with Zeus build system or as standalone scripts
